# NetworkApplicationProject
Network Application Project for COSC 4P14 (Computer Networks)

The code consists of two classes: TCPServer.java and TCPClient.java. You will first need to execute TCPServer.java on a terminal window using the following command: "java TCPServer.java 4000". After executing the server you will need to run TWO instances of the client on TWO different terminal windows by using the following command: "java TCPClient.java localhost 4000". Once all these three steps are completed you will be able to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with those two clients that connected to the server. Both clients will be prompted to choose between 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'. Once both clients insert their choice the server will calculate who the winner of the game is. The server will then send a respective "win" or "lose" message to the clients based on the choice they made for the game. The server will then close and both clients will be disconnected. If you wish to run the game again you will have to start up the server and the two clients again.
